- Transaction logging and history management
- Transaction reversal capabilities for reconciliation
- Responsive web interface with modern UI/UX

### Core Features Implemented

#### 1. Account Management
- **Multi-Currency Support**: KES (Kenyan Shilling), USD (US Dollar), NGN (Nigerian Naira)
- **Account Types**: Bank accounts, Mobile money (M-Pesa), Forex reserves, Treasury reserves
- **Real-Time Balance Updates**: Instant balance reflection after transfers
- **Portfolio Overview**: Total portfolio value converted to USD

#### 2. Fund Transfer System

- **Transfer Validation**: Insufficient balance checks and account validation
- **Transaction Notes**: Optional memo field for transfer documentation

#### 3. Foreign Exchange (FX) Handling
- **Static Exchange Rates**: Predefined rates for demo purposes
  - USD to KES: 1:150
  - USD to NGN: 1:1600
  - KES to NGN: 1:10.67
- **Automatic Conversion**: Real-time calculation during cross-currency transfers
- **Rate Display**: Shows conversion rates and amounts in transfer modal

#### 4. Transaction Management & Reconciliation
- **Comprehensive Transaction Log**: All transfers recorded with unique IDs
- **Transaction Reversal**: Full reversal capability for reconciliation
- **Transaction Types**: Regular transfers and FX conversions clearly differentiated
- **Audit Trail**: Complete history with timestamps and transaction details
- **Reversal Protection**: Prevents double reversals and reversal of reversal transactions

#### 5. User Interface & Experience
- **Modern Design**: Clean, professional interface using Tailwind CSS and Shadcn UI
- **Responsive Layout**: Works across desktop and mobile devices
- **Real-Time Updates**: Live balance and transaction updates
- **Filtering Options**: Transaction filtering by currency
- **Visual Indicators**: Color-coded currencies and transaction status badges

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture
- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with Shadcn UI components
- **State Management**: React hooks with custom useTreasury hook
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and building
- **Code Quality**: ESLint, Prettier, and TypeScript checks via GitHub Actions

### Data Structure
- **Accounts**: ID, name, currency, balance
- **Transactions**: Comprehensive transaction records with FX details
- **Currency Conversion**: Utility functions for rate calculations

## Assumptions Made

### 1. Exchange Rates
- **Static Rates**: Using fixed exchange rates for demonstration
- **Rate Source**: Rates are hardcoded for consistency in demo environment
- **Rate Updates**: No real-time rate fetching (would integrate with API in production)

### 2. Data Persistence
- **In-Memory Storage**: Data persists only during session
- **No Backend**: Simulated environment without database integration
- **Demo Data**: Pre-populated with realistic account balances

### 3. Transaction Processing
- **Instant Settlement**: All transfers process immediately
- **No Processing Fees**: Transfers are fee-free for simplicity
- **Unlimited Reversals**: Any transaction can be reversed if destination has sufficient balance

### 4. User Interface
- **Single User**: No authentication or multi-user support
- **Desktop First**: Optimized for desktop with mobile responsiveness
- **English Only**: Single language support

### 5. Compliance & Security
- **Demo Environment**: No real financial data or regulations applied
- **No Audit Requirements**: Simplified audit trail for demonstration
- **No Security Layer**: No encryption or security measures (demo only)

## Real-World Finance Operations Alignment

### Accurate Workflow Simulation
- **Treasury Operations**: Mirrors real treasury fund movement processes
- **Reconciliation**: Implements proper reversal mechanisms
- **Multi-Currency**: Handles complex FX scenarios common in international finance
- **Audit Trail**: Maintains complete transaction history for reconciliation

### Industry Best Practices
- **Transaction IDs**: Unique identifiers for all transactions
- **Balance Validation**: Prevents overdrafts and invalid transfers
- **Currency Handling**: Proper decimal precision and formatting
- **Status Tracking**: Clear transaction status indicators

## Improvements for Production Environment

### 1. Enhanced Data Management
- **Database Integration**: PostgreSQL or similar for data persistence
- **Real-Time Sync**: Live data synchronization across users
- **Backup & Recovery**: Automated backup systems
- **Data Encryption**: End-to-end encryption for sensitive financial data

### 2. Advanced FX Capabilities
- **Live Exchange Rates**: Integration with FX rate APIs (e.g., XE, Fixer.io)
- **Rate History**: Historical rate tracking and analysis
- **FX Risk Management**: Hedging and exposure calculations
- **Multi-Provider Rates**: Rate comparison from multiple sources

### 3. Enhanced Security & Compliance
- **User Authentication**: Multi-factor authentication system
- **Role-Based Access**: Different permission levels for users
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive audit trails for compliance
- **Regulatory Compliance**: AML, KYC, and financial regulations adherence

### 4. Advanced Features
- **Batch Processing**: Handle multiple transfers simultaneously
- **Scheduled Transfers**: Automated recurring transfers
- **Approval Workflows**: Multi-level approval for large transfers
- **Notification System**: Real-time alerts and notifications
- **Reporting Dashboard**: Advanced analytics and reporting tools

### 5. Integration Capabilities
- **Banking APIs**: Direct integration with banking systems
- **ERP Integration**: Connect with enterprise resource planning systems
